# Algorithm-and-Data-Strucutures

This is just a set of Algorithms and Data Strucures courseowrk that
I have work on. The Algorithm and Data Strucures that are us in this
course range from Bubble sort to Dijkstra and also deal with Hash table.
Review of basic data structures. Graph, search paths, and spanning trees. 
Algorithm design and analysis of sorting, merging, and searching. Memory management, 
hashing, dynamic storage allocation. Integration of data structures into system design.
